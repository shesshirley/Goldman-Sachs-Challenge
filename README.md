# Goldman Sachs Challenge

The project is trying to find how environment influences the stock market, whether the CO2 emission value will influence the close stock price? Or will the scope of the company in correpsonding industry will influence the stock price? 

We are using the two Data Sources for the challenge from the Snowflake Data Marketplace to figure out the answer: US Stock Market Data For Data Science and Environment Data Atlas. After cleanning the data and extract some of the valuable information, we are trying to do the data analysis, such as find the correlation between the industry and the indicator, that is, the environment indicator such as the CO2 emission mentioned above. Later, we are doing some model selection to try to predict the close stock price accoridng to some feature selected.

We also met some challenge such as dealing with the missing value, find the metrics to see how industry related to the enviroment indicator and how to select suitbale regression models to do the prediction.
